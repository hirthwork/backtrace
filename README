Backtrace helper library
========================

Introduction
------------
The purpose of this library is to provide easy way to current program call
stack.

Rationale
---------
This library provides ability to retrieve current call stack with function
demangling and "backtrace_symbols" strings parsing, so you can store this
information in exception object.

Overview
--------
The only thing you need to use backtrace helper is to include `backtrace.hpp`
and link libbacktrace.so. After that you can retrieve current call stack by
calling function `GetBacktrace`.

Installation
------------
You require bjam (a.k.a. boost build) to install this package.
In order to launch sanity test you need Boost.Test to be installed.

  * In order to install, execute bjam with argument
    `dist --includedir=<prefix>`, where `<prefix>` is the installation path
    where library will be installed. More precisely, `reinvented-wheels`
    subfolder will be created, containing all required headers.
  * In order to launch the test, execute bjam with `-d0 test release` argument
    and ensure that return code was 0.
